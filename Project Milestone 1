I would like to think my project is off to a good start. I took the advice that I received from you and my fellow classmates and really thought about what I wanted this project to be. After a quick search on the world wide web, I have been enlightened to see that there are many projects over Sabermetrics in baseball. It seems to very popular topic that has been researched over the years. The material that peoples before me have completed seem to be a lot more advanced than what my capabilities are in Python. With that being The stats I want to focus on are those from batting stats. Three batting stats that can help show if the player is good is On-Base Plus Slugging (OPS), On-Base Percentage (OBP), and Total Bases (TB). By analyzing these three stats it can show who the best hitters are in the league but what I am looking for is the hiding gem thatâ€™s going to have a break season that is on the lower end of the payroll spectrum.

There are a lot of good Datasets out there that are available. I am going to go with the most reliable one in my opinion is from the MLB directly.

This dataset is tied in with Statcast powered by Google Cloud. If you watch any baseball game on ESPN, they are always showing you stats that are from this database. The MLB has kept stats on players going back all the way to the first year of its existence back in the 1800s. There is more than enough information that I can pull stats on players to help get this project started and completed.
