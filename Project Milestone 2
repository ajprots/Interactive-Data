This has been a very business week with lots of family coming into town and a funeral, so I didn’t get as far as I was planning on. I feel like I am a little behind but can make up ground now with an empty house. I almost need to have a project milestone 2.5 and maybe set up a meeting with you sometime this week just to go over somethings. Last class was very helpful in deciding on how to measure the weight of each stat and what I should be measuring them too. I think talking about it out loud and getting another person’s perspective on it. I want to play around with heat maps and scatter plots. Looking at graphs that are popular for presenting baseball stats are bar graphs, stacked bar graphs, scatter plots, and heat maps. These are the graphs that I have in mine to start with to see which ones would present the best visualization for my parameters. What you said in class about the scatterplot with different colors. Red meaning representing players are MVP type players. Blue representing players that are on the outside looking in and if they improved, they have a chance to be a red type player. Finally grey representing players who are nowhere near MVP caliber.
